Try searching for these with a Camera.\n- The MEL allows you to detect ghostly writings/drawings as well as pentagrams in addition to cursed objects, even if they are invisible to the naked eye.\n- If the entity requires a Corrupt object to be destroyed, you can find it by using the Occult Meter. The meter will flash red when in close proximity to the corrupt object. If you have an MEL you can even verify that the object is Corrupt, because the MEL will give a reading of above 65 OCC when in close proximity to the corrupt object.\n- The Exorcism Book will function as long as you are using it while standing in the haunted area, and pause briefly between each exorcism line, even while the ghost attacks you, or is far away from you.",
    "tuto_global" : "You are a ghost hunter. Your goal is to investigate entities, accurately determine which type of entity it is, then destroy it. The entities that haunt these locations are generally very aggressive. Do not try to hide. Fight them with your equipment, instead.\n\nHere are the basic steps to complete your mission:\n\n1) Choose your mission carefully. Different difficulty levels may appear on the mission board. The higher the difficulty, the more often the entity will manifest and attack.\n\n<color=red>/!\\ Before starting the mission, remember to buy enough equipment (in the Ghost Market app) so that you don't run out tools during a hunt.</color>\n\n2) Once the mission has started, head to the back of the vehicle and check the white-board for your side-objectives. The nearby on-board computer will provide you with the equipment that you have previously purchased from the Ghost Market.\n\n3) Place or use tools/equipment that will help you determine the various pieces of evidence within the haunting site.\n\n4) Once a piece of evidence is found, open your tablet, open the Ghostpedia app and enter the evidence in the appropriate section. You will also need to figure out what type of entity is causing the paranormal activity by observing its appearance, interactions, movements, and general behavior. \n\n (A description of each entity type can be found in the Ghostpedia).\n\n5) Once the type of entity has been identified, select it within the Category section in the Ghostpedia app.\n\n6) You must now exorcise the entity!\nTo do this, the Ghostpedia app will calculate the evidence you've provided and give you the appropriate exorcism protocol to follow. Open the protocol by clicking the green button at the bottom of the Ghostpedia app. You will have to complete all of the exorcism steps to fully banish the evil entity from the world.\n\n7) Once the spirit has been exorcised, and the side-objectives completed (or not), all you have to do is return to the base!\n\nSome beginners tips:\n- If you flee the mission without exorcising the entity, the equipment you deployed or placed outside of the vehicle will be left behind. (so if you must flee, be sure to bring as much of your equipment back to the vehicle as you can, first!)\n- In multiplayer, bringing your teammate's unconscious body back to the vehicle will allow them to recover some of the money and experience from the mission.\n- The ghost will react to simple requests and names that are often used to refer to it. To interact with them, you will have to use expressions like: \n“Name (Ghost/Spirit/...) + Action (Write/Light/Speak/Say/...)” ",
