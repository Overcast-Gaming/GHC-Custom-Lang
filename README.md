# GHC-Custom-Lang
A custom language file for Ghost Hunters Corp

# How do I install it?
Download the repository, and drag the `English.json` file to your game's language file directory (usually `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Ghost Hunters Corp/language`)
Once the file is moved, open your GHC settings (Escape -> Settings), then click on language, then change language to English (you can just click on english if it is not set to it already)
